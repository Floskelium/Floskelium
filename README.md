# Hello World! 👋
I'm **Florian H.**, a **Data Engineering and Analytics (M.Sc)** and **Informatics Graduate (B.Sc)** from the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
With a strong foundation in app development and backend engineering, I specialize and love collecting, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets, as showcased in my projects.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🌱 Currently exploring: **Full-stack (mobile & web) applications and creative data collection projects**
- 💡 Passionate about: **Developing innovative solutions for real-world problems, optimizing backend systems, and uncovering insights from diverse datasets**
- 📫 How to reach me: **florian.j.hauck@tum.de**

Fun fact: I started programming in 5th grade, later wrote various Minecraft server plugins and hosted a game server, which fueled my love for coding.
Since then, I've been setting and spiking challenges in volleyball, strategizing moves in chess (I even wrote my own chess engine in school ^^), and building tools for impactful projects.
